# hello-world
A repository for my introduction

Hi people! 
I'm cautiousGranola, welcome to my profile, I guess? I like history, animals, books, and animation. 
I'm still new to coding, and it takes me a long time to finish a project. 
This profile is where I will be keeping my coding projects. 

Have a nice day! :D
